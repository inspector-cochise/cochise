name = Question 10

Q0 = Are the file permissions on the dynamically loadable modules (i. e. .so libraries) set in a way that they can't be changed by unauthorized users?

L1 = I'll now check whether any other user than root has write-access to one of the modules you load...
L2 = I found some files causing problems (in most cases this means some other user than root has write access)
S1_good = Seems like only root has write-access to the dynamically loadable modules.
S1_bad  = Other users than root may have write-access to the above listed modules or their containing directories.
