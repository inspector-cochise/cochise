Cochise 0.3-RC1 (2012)

Cochise is a tool which will assist you performing a security audit on our apache web-server. The special audit performed was specified by the BSI (A german government institute for computer-security), you can find it here: https://www.bsi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/478398/publicationFile/30917/isi_web_server_checkliste_apache_pdf.pdf

Not that in Cochise 0.3 only a part of the mentioned audit is implemented.

You will need to run this tool as root. Don't be scared, it will not make any changes to the configuration of your server. Cochise is designed to run on unix-like systems, you may try to run it on other systems with POSIX emulation but don't expect too much.

See RUNNING on how to start Cochise.
