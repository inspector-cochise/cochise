Cochise 0.1 (2011)

Cochise is a tool which will assist you performing a security audit on our apache web-server. The special audit performed was specified by the BSI (A german government institute for computer-security), you can find it here: https://www.bsi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/478398/publicationFile/30917/isi_web_server_checkliste_apache_pdf.pdf

You will need to run this tool as root. Don't be scared, it will not make any changes to the configuration of your server. Cochise is designed to run on unix-like systems, you may try to ru it on other systems with POSIX emulation but don't expect too much.

As the version number 0.1 may let's you guess this software is still in a very early state of development. So it is very likely that it may shows some unexpected or buggy behaviour.

If you have any questions or found a bug, feel free to contact us.
