Q0 = Do only users with administrative rights have read- or write-access to the apache-web-server configuration?

S1 = Your apache configuration file(s) seem to be safe. I.e. only members of root have any access to it/them.
S2 = Users not in the group "root" may have some access to the configuration files listed below. These users shouldn't get any permissions (no read, no write, no execute)
